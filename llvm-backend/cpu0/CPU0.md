# CPU0 Architecture
More details about CPU0 arch and its instruction set, checkout this page(http://ccckmit.wikidot.com/ocs:cpu0), and git repo see this [page](https://github.com/Jonathan2251/lbt.git), It include the implementation of a `compiler backend, linker, llvm-objdump, elf2hex` as well as `Verilog` language source code of Cpu0 instruction set.

This tutorial started using the LLVM 3.1 Mips backend as a reference and sync to llvm 3.5 Mips at version 3.5.3. You will learn how to develop a toolchain as well as design a CPU based on the LLVM infrastructure.
